# PRODUCTIVITY-APP

The idea of Productivity App is to keep as simple as posible all your tasks listed and organised.

It is basically a simple task list app where the users are able to create, edit, delete and list all the tasks that must done to complete the day in a good way.

As it's shown bellow, this would be the final goal to achieve to complete the app development. For this project, only the basic functions have been developed.

As main goals of this project:
Understand the React architecture, the reuse of the components and the differents hooks that facilitate when developing. The use of the Router to navigate to diferents path within the app. And how to interact in an organised and secure way with the backend API.
